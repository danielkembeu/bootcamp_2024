Today:
1. Destructuring (ES6 feature)

3. Updating a state by its setter function.
4. (extras) Reusable component -> MyCustomButton.


EXERCICE:

1. Create a Reusable component which is called CustomTitle that contains a label with the icon `>` at the right. It has to be in his own file.

2. Create a simple form that contains just one styled input and a button at the bottom right side of it, with the header being that custom component, coming from the definition file.

3. Call to form components and passing the appropriate props in the App.jsx/tsx in order to display them.
